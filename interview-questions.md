# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: When you take an object and you break it apart

  Researched answer: Destructuring on objects lets you bind variables to different properties of an object.



2. What are the three arguments that .map() and .filter() can accept?

  Your answer: the current item, the current index, the array you called filter on

  Researched answer: Same as above :)



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class works on everything not just objects and objects can only work on one thing?

  Researched answer: A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: I don't even know what a span is....

  Researched answer: The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.



5. What is React.Fragment and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: React.Fragment takes the JSX and sends it to the DOM to be displayed?

  Researched answer:React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React. Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div.



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: being able to play on the app, forms, any kind of submissions really...yes?

  Researched answer: Flexible layouts - Using a flexible grid to create the website layout that will dynamically resize to any width.
Media queries - An extension to media types when targeting and including styles.

- Object oriented programming - Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.
- irb - An institutional review board, also known as an independent ethics committee, ethical review board, or research ethics board, is a type of committee that applies research ethics by reviewing the methods proposed for research to ensure that they are ethical.
- Instance variable - In object-oriented programming with classes, an instance variable is a variable defined in a class, for which each instantiated object of the class has a separate copy, or instance. An instance variable is similar to a class variable.
- Ruby hash - Ruby - Hashes. Advertisements. A Hash is a collection of key-value pairs like this: "employee" = > "salary". It is similar to an Array, except that indexing is done via arbitrary keys of any object type, not an integer index.
- Class relationships - It is these relationships that bind instances classes together to form programs and that provide the connections that allow those instances to communicate and to cooperate. ... Within class diagrams, the UML defines five relationships that may exist between classes: inheritance (also known as generalization) association.
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby - Ruby getters and setters Method. ... these methods allow us to access a class's instance variable from outside the class. Getter methods are used to get the value of an instance variable while the setter methods are used to set the value of an instance variable of some class.
